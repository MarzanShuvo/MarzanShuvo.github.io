        <p> I found an amazing specialization named Modern Robotics: Mechanics, Planning, and Control. 
            I started my quest for robotics by enrolling in this specialization. I have learned a lot 
            of new concepts like core mathematical terms of robot manipulator and mobile robots, forward 
            kinematics, inverse kinematics, forward dynamics, inverse dynamics, trajectory planning, 
            controlling( Feed Forward +PI controller), kinematics of mobile robots, grasping, Odometry, etc.
            This is actually a theory based specialization but after each theory, there was some assignments 
            where I had to code with my gained theoretical knowledge for the simulation in CoppeliaSim. 
            This was the most amazing and challenging part of this specialization. At the end of this specialization, 
            I have done an interesting capstone project where I had to write a software in python for a pick and place 
            mobile manipulator. I had to combine all of the knowledge that I learned throughout this specialization.</p>
